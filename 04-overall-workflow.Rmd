# Overall Workflow

## Starting a DevOps project

- Make a project in DevOps

- Clone the repository to a local directory. Open your desired folder in File Explorer, right click and select "Git Bash here".
```sh
git clone <project_name>
```

Cloning is the git actions which makes a copy of your project from DevOps on your computer which allows you to work on the code. It also records the location of your DevOps repository on your computer which allows you to share (push) your changes back to DevOps once you have done some work. This is a bit like OneDrive syncing your files with the cloud apart from the fact it only happens when specifically tell it to.

We recommend that, to get the most from DevOps, you use it from the start of a project. This allows a continuous process of making small changes and having them QA'd, instead of doing a huge QA right at the end. However, you may have started a repository locally and wish to put it on DevOps. In that case you can push to DevOps.

- Add the DevOps repository as your "remote"
```sh
git remote add origin <repo_URL>
```

- Push your local changes up to DevOps (make sure you've committed your changes first!)
```sh
git push -u origin --all <repo_URL>
```

## Making Branches

- Work may be assigned to you as a "Work Item". In DevOps use the link to make new branch. To correct a bug, prefix the branch name with "bug/". To add new functionality, prefix the branch name with "feature/".

- Make sure your main branch is up to date.
```sh 
git pull
```
Your local repository will now "know" about the branch you just made.

- Checkout the branch you made on DevOps (make sure the branch names are the same).
```sh 
git checkout <your_branch_name>
```

## Making Changes

- Make your code changes

- Commit your changes. You can make as many commits as you need to. As ever, make 
them roughly self-contained chunks that would be easy for someone to review piece by piece.
```sh
git add <file_list>
```
```sh
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

## Merging
:::: {.infoboxblue .info data-latex=”info”}

**Reminder: "master" branch vs "main" branch**

Repositories usually have either a "main" or a "master" branch. The two terms refer to the same thing but "main" is considered more inclusive language. Our examples in this chapter will refer to a "main" branch rather than a "master" one.

::::

- When you've made enough changes to complete your work item checkout the main 
branch in your local repository do a pull in case anyone else had made changes.
```sh 
git checkout main
```
```sh 
git pull
```

- Switch back to your working branch. Merge any changes from main.
```sh 
git checkout <your_branch_name>
```
```sh 
git merge main
```

- Sort out any merge conflicts.
```sh 
git status
``` will list the files that have merge conflicts. Open the files with 
the conflicts, and search them for "<<<<". Everything from the next line up until 
a line of "====" will be from the main branch. Everything from the "====" line 
until ">>>>" will be from your working branch. Work through the code to make sure 
that you keep all the necessary changes. There may be changes from main and your branch that you want to keep, so don't just idly delete things!
Add and commit the changes.
```sh 
git add <file_to_be_merged>
```
```sh 
git commit -m "Commit message (it's advised to mention the merge)"
```

## Getting your changes back on to DevOps

- Push (send) your changes to DevOps
```sh 
git push
```

- On DevOps make a pull request for your branch

- Have someone review your work. If any changes are required, go back to [Making Changes](#making-changes) and work from there again.

- Merge your branch into main

- Find some more work, go back to the top and start again, Sisyphus!
