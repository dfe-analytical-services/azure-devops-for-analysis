## Work Items

DevOps has rich project management functionality that can be used to manage projects of all sizes. At it's most complex you can utilise a mix of **Epics**, **Stories**, **Features**, **Tasks**, **Issues** and **User stories** to manage your project. 

These terms and planning stages for a project come from software development. 

Instead we recommend treating **features** as the main type of work item and breaking your workload down into a number of features. This is similar to what you would do on GitHub with Issues. 

With **features** you can again add lots of metadata but the most useful will be the following:

1. Name
2. Description
3. Assigned to

There are then numerous ways to visualise work allocations across Azure DevOps ranging from individual task assignments to project boards (similar to trello boards).

By utilising work items you take out the need for tracking tasks manually.
